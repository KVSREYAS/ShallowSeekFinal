Definition: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air.
Process: Plants take in sunlight, water from the soil, and a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. They use these to make food and release oxygen, which we breathe.
Equation:
Sunlight + Water + Air (Carbon Dioxide) â†’ Food (Glucose) + Oxygen
Examples: Trees, grass, and flowers make their own food using photosynthesis.
